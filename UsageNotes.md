# Usage Notes
## Bugs
- KeyNav breaks down when I add/remove inputs (generate stable keys for input fields)
## UX Improvements
- Color scheme by leading directory
- Daily could include shortcut for no weekends or weekly could include shortcut for multiple days of the week
- Note until date in preview and allow for inf recur
- Calendar view event display indent can only reset to 0, allow to reset to larger indent.
- Add hover to show info about certain buttons
- Add move field to form
