# Usage Notes
## Bugs
- KeyNav breaks down when I add/remove inputs (generate stable keys for input fields)
- Allow KeyNav to focus buttons or some other method so I can use keys to hit buttons
## UX Improvements
- Color scheme by leading directory
- Add suggestions for inputs
- Add default option definition for events in form creation
- Daily could include shortcut for no weekends or weekly could include shortcut for multiple days of the week
- Note until date in preview and allow for inf recur
- Calendar view event display indent can only reset to 0, allow to reset to larger indent.
